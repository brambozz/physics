## 2020 plans

### 2020-05-17: 5k hanzeloop
+ *Goal* relaxed and injury-free 20'
+ *Requirements* strong and flexible ankles, mileage

Cancelled due to corona.

### Restore achilles injury

I have had an achilles injury for some years now. It is progressively
getting better, but I want to double down on my efforts. What I will
be doing is:
+ Move through range of motion (i.e. squat) many times a day
+ Do isometric and eccentric loading often
+ Slowly increase running mileage by running more often in the week
	and more distance per run

#### New plan 2020-07-05

Because the last run with some sprints seemed to be too much too quick,
I will stop running in july and really do the exercises better.
Concretely, do every day at least once:
+ Two leg little jumps until fatigue
+ 10 Full squats
+ Isometric loading by standing on one leg

Also have to read up on some research.

### Handstand

I want to be able to do a handstand, because it is cool. But also for
progressing towards handstand pushups as ultimate strength exercise.

## 2021 plans

### 2021-05-??: 5k hanzeloop
+ *Goal* injury-free 18'
+ *Requirements* strong and flexible ankles, considerable training
