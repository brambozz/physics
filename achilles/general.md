# Achilles tendon injury

This document logs my thoughts about my achilles tendon injury.

## Cause

From the *Achilles tendinopathy* review I read that there are a lot of
factors associated with achilles tendinopathy. One obvious one is 
athletic overuse, which could very well be a factor for me. Another one
is forefoot varus, which I also have (related to pronation). This leads
me to believe that switching to barefoot may also be a cause. When I
walk, I pronate, and that may cause excessive load on the tendon.

## Severity

I did the VISA-A questionnaire to see how severe I am. My score was 58.

## Protocol

After a lot of reading, I have decided that I will follow the 
[Silbernagel protocol](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0363546506298279) conservatively. I keep a journal in this repository under 
`silbernagel.md`.
