# Exercises

## Two-legged heel raises
Start with both feet flat and support with hands at wall or otherwise.
Slowly raise both heels and come back down.

## One-legged heel raises
See two-legged heel raises

## Eccentric heel raises
Start with both feet flat and support. Raise both heels and go slowly
back on one foot.

## Quick rebounding heel raises
Start with both feet flat and support. Jump without the toes leaving the
floor and come down at normal speed. Go back up when the heel is
approximately 1 cm from the floor.

## All exercises on a step
Same, but start with both heels as far as possible down.

# Log

## 2020-10-06

raises were surprisingly tiring, especially for the right leg. The foot
was shaking quite heavily, so probably missing quite some strength.
