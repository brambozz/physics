I started doing strength training in the spirit of the 
*Primal Blueprint* by Mark Sisson. This means I do a short, but intense,
strength training session about every 10 days. According to PB this
should only be done when feeling good and energized. The 10 days then
leaves plenty of time for the muscles to restore and grow a little
stronger.

Doing pullups, pushups and bear walks.

Also did *Sportklimmen A*, first climbing course.

Starting regular strength workouts. The current program is:
1. Pull ups until failure, hold at last (partial) pull up.
2. Push ups on fists until close to failure.
3. One round of bear crawls through the room.

The above three points I do three times in a row. For the last time, I
push up until failure and do two rounds of bear crawls.
I do some shaking and stretching in between all exercises.

In January I progressed from 2 pull ups the first rep to 4 pull ups the
first rep.

To reach my 5k hanzeloop goal in May, I started doing the following
running routine.

+ Run ~2 times a week.
+ Walk at least 30' every day.
+ Do ankle strength exercise of Kit.

## 2020-03-02
### Strength session
+ *pullups* 5 - 3 - 3
+ *pushups* 10 - 8 - 8
+ *bearcrawls* 1 - 1 - 2

## 2020-03-13
Started to incorporate tabletop holds into the strength training routine
to prepare for handstand.

### Strength session
+ *pullups* 5.5 - 3.5 - 2.75
+ *pushups* 10 - 8 - 7
+ *bearcrawls* 1 - 1 - 2
+ *tabletop* 25'' - 30'' - 60''

#### Comments
Had climbing yesterday, might be bit tired still. first effort
felt good, feel like i am getting stronger. 
tabletop hold for 60'' resulted in twitching in lower left arm.
Had to go pretty deep for 60''.

## 2020-03-23
From today I will be more strict on pullup form.
1. Full relaxed deadhang
2. Engage core by compressing knees slightly upwards
3. First full scapular engagement
4. Continue to full pullup without protruding chin or leg movement

### Strength session
+ *pullups* 3.75 - 2.5 - 2.5
+ *pushups* 10 - 9 - 8
+ *bearcrawls* 1 - 1 - x
+ *tabletop* 30'' - 30'' - x

#### Comments
Felt a bit sore at the beginning, probably due to yoga session 
yesterday. Pullups with proper form is definitely harder. I think I did
a bit of kipping to get 5+ earlier. Pushups felt good, but tweaked my
back on the last one, so skipped bearcrawls and tabletop.

## 2020-04-04

### Strength session
+ *pullups* 4.5 - 3 - 3
+ *pushups* 10 - 10 - 9
+ *bearcrawls* 1 - 1 - 2
+ *tabletop* 30'' - 30'' - 60''

#### Comments
This time all felt really good. And pullups really improved! Still had
twitching in lower left arm at final table top hold.

## 2020-04-15

### Strength session
+ *pullups* 4.5 - 3.5 - 3.5
+ *pushups* 11 - 10 - 9
+ *bearcrawls* 2 - 2 - 2
+ *tabletop* 30'' - 30'' - 60''

#### Comments
Felt tired in my head, but surprisingly got better than last time. I did
enforce about a 5 minute break between sets, so that probably helped. To
clarify: 1 bearcrawl is three stretches or one traverse through the 
room.

## 2020-04-25

### Strength session
+ *pullups* 5 - 3.75 - 3.75
+ *pushups* 12 - 10 - 12
+ *bearcrawls* 2 - 2 - 2
+ *tabletop* 30'' - 30'' - 60''

#### Comments
Felt supergood today.

## 2020-06-15

Started with actively trying to improve my sleep quality. The first
thing I introduce is no screens after 22:00.

## 2020-06-17

### Run
+ *Distance* 5k

## 2020-06-19

### Run
+ *Distance* 5k

#### Comments
First time in a while I ran 5k without stopping. It was at a low pace,
but I hardly felt my ankles! I will try to increase running frequency
to every other day, to observe the effect on my ankles.

## 2020-06-22

### Run
+ *Distance 5k*

#### Comments
Ankles felt good in the beginning. Stopped running once, to be on the
safe side.

## 2020-06-24

### Run
+ *Distance 2k*

#### Comments
Ankles felt immediately quite sensitive, so I did a few short bits of
running, but mostly walking. Not sure if I ran too much, or whether it
is just a temporary setback.

### Strength session
+ *pullups* 5 - 3.75 - 3.25
+ *pushups* 10 - 10 - 9
+ *bearcrawls* 2 - 2 - 2

#### Comments
First time strength training in 2 months. I stopped because of shoulder
pain (right shoulder), but that did not go fully away yet. 
I don't think stopping strength training made it much better. 
Surprisingly, I have hardly dropped strength in two months.

## 2020-07-02

### Run
+ *Distance 5k*

#### Comments
The achilles tendons felt a bit sensitive, but in general it felt pretty
good. That led me to try doing two sprints, after which they felt
significantly more sensitive. Also a couple of days later, I feel them
more than usual. I think it is best to stop running for a while and
really faithfully do exercises every day and try running again in
August, to see whether that is a good strategy.

## 2020-07-06

### Strength session
+ *pullups* 5 - 4.5 - 3.75
+ *pushups* 12 - 10 - 10
+ *bearcrawls* 2 - 2 - 2
+ *rest* 5' - 5'

#### Comments
Today I felt tired, but nonetheless the pullups were easier than last
time. The first 5 could have been more, but I had to laugh too much.


## 2020-07-11

Got a tick bite, removed it the same day. On the left foot, near the
ankle. Should check in a few weeks, to see if it was correctly removed.

### Boulder session
First boulder session in GRIP! Got a monthly subscription, so I will be
going a lot. I did grade 3 and 4 boulders. Lot of forearm muscle pain
the next day.

## 2020-07-22

### Boulder session
Bouldered with Riccardo, did quite some grade 5 boulders, already felt
a bit stronger than last time.

## 2020-07-27

### Boulder session
Again tried many 5 boulders, got two ones which I did not send before.
The day after I had a lot less soreness in the forearms already.

## 2020-07-29

### Strength session
+ *pullups* 5 - 4.75 - 4
+ *pushups* 13 - 11 - 11
+ *pistol squats* 1 - 2 - 3
+ *bearcrawls* 2 - 2 - 2
+ *rest* 5' - 5'

#### Comments
My endurance seems to have increased, but max strength not too much. In
the pullups I felt that the forearms were tired more quickly than the
upper arms. Probably from climbing on monday. I started with pistol
squats, using a book under the heel. I will gradually increase this
until I hit max and then work towards removing the book.

## 2020-07-30

### Boulder session
The two 5 boulders I did not send last time, I still did not, although
I tried many times. I did do a 6a dynamic one and felt in general
stronger in terms of grip.

## 2020-08-02

### Boulder session
Managed to send the two 5 boulders, today really quickly. One in one go
and the other after two or three tries. Also tried a couple of 6a 
boulders and that went generally quite well. I notice that recovery seems 
to be going quick.

## 2020-08-16

### Boulder session
Good session, although I felt a bit less strong than last session. The
overhanging 5 still took me 10+ tries, but I sent it again.

### Logging weight
I want to log my weight, such that I can do food experiments without
getting lighter. It is also nice to be able to see weight progress and
maybe correlate it with some things. Today I wanted to establish the
time of day where I am lightest and weighed myself six times.

+ After morning pee: 57.9
+ After breakfast: 58.7
+ Before lunch: 58.3
+ After lunch: 59.0
+ Before dinner: 58.3
+ After dinner: 59.4

From this it seems the morning is the lightest, so I will take that as
reference point. I forgot to weigh before sleep, so will do that 
tomorrow.

### Weight

### Boulder session
Once again the overhanging 5 proved too difficult. I tried another 5 in
the arena many many times, but couldn't send it. In general I did not
feel very strong.

### Boulder session
Great session, felt quite strong in the fingers, despite going 
bouldering two days ago. Also flashed the overhanging 5 this time! I
tried many 6a and sent a couple of them. I will project a 6b in the
arena.

Highest grade climbed: 6a

### Boulder session
Even though this was the third session in 4 days, I felt strongest in
the fingers for all of them. I was struggling before on a 5 and a 6a
boulder and still did not get them, but got very close on both, so at 
least progress. Tweaked my neck a little on the 5 and started feeling
my right shoulder. I did send one new 6a.

Highest grade climbed: 6a
