I started doing strength training in the spirit of the 
*Primal Blueprint* by Mark Sisson. This means I do a short, but intense,
strength training session about every 10 days. According to PB this
should only be done when feeling good and energized. The 10 days then
leaves plenty of time for the muscles to restore and grow a little
stronger.

Doing pullups, pushups and bear walks.

Also did *Sportklimmen A*, first climbing course.

Starting regular strength workouts. The current program is:
1. Pull ups until failure, hold at last (partial) pull up.
2. Push ups on fists until close to failure.
3. One round of bear crawls through the room.

The above three points I do three times in a row. For the last time, I
push up until failure and do two rounds of bear crawls.
I do some shaking and stretching in between all exercises.

In January I progressed from 2 pull ups the first rep to 4 pull ups the
first rep.

## 2020-03-01
To reach my 5k hanzeloop goal in May, I started doing the following
running routine.

+ Run ~2 times a week.
+ Walk at least 30' every day.
+ Do ankle strength exercise of Kit.

## 2020-03-02
### Strength session
+ *pullups* 5 - 3 - 3
+ *pushups* 10 - 8 - 8
+ *bearcrawls* 1 - 1 - 2

## 2020-03-13
Started to incorporate tabletop holds into the strength training routine
to prepare for handstand.

### Strength session
+ *pullups* 5.5 - 3.5 - 2.75
+ *pushups* 10 - 8 - 7
+ *bearcrawls* 1 - 1 - 2
+ *tabletop* 25'' - 30'' - 60''

#### Comments
Had climbing yesterday, might be bit tired still. first effort
felt good, feel like i am getting stronger. 
tabletop hold for 60'' resulted in twitching in lower left arm.
Had to go pretty deep for 60''.

## 2020-03-23
From today I will be more strict on pullup form.
1. Full relaxed deadhang
2. Engage core by compressing knees slightly upwards
3. First full scapular engagement
4. Continue to full pullup without protruding chin or leg movement

### Strength session
+ *pullups* 3.75 - 2.5 - 2.5
+ *pushups* 10 - 9 - 8
+ *bearcrawls* 1 - 1 - x
+ *tabletop* 30'' - 30'' - x

#### Comments
Felt a bit sore at the beginning, probably due to yoga session 
yesterday. Pullups with proper form is definitely harder. I think I did
a bit of kipping to get 5+ earlier. Pushups felt good, but tweaked my
back on the last one, so skipped bearcrawls and tabletop.

## 2020-04-04

### Strength session
+ *pullups* 4.5 - 3 - 3
+ *pushups* 10 - 10 - 9
+ *bearcrawls* 1 - 1 - 2
+ *tabletop* 30'' - 30'' - 60''

#### Comments
This time all felt really good. And pullups really improved! Still had
twitching in lower left arm at final table top hold.

## 2020-04-15

### Strength session

+ *pushups* 11 - 10 - 9
+ *bearcrawls* 2 - 2 - 2
+ *tabletop* 30'' - 30'' - 60''

#### Comments
Felt tired in my head, but surprisingly got better than last time. I did
enforce about a 5 minute break between sets, so that probably helped. To
clarify: 1 bearcrawl is three stretches or one traverse through the 
room.

## 2020-04-25

#### Comments
Felt supergood today.

## 2020-06-15

Started with actively trying to improve my sleep quality. The first
thing I introduce is no screens after 22:00.

## 2020-06-17

### Run
+ *Distance* 5k

## 2020-06-19

### Run
+ *Distance* 5k

#### Comments
First time in a while I ran 5k without stopping. It was at a low pace,
but I hardly felt my ankles! I will try to increase running frequency
to every other day, to observe the effect on my ankles.

## 2020-06-22

### Run
+ *Distance 5k*

#### Comments
Ankles felt good in the beginning. Stopped running once, to be on the
safe side.

## 2020-06-24

### Run
+ *Distance 2k*

#### Comments
Ankles felt immediately quite sensitive, so I did a few short bits of
running, but mostly walking. Not sure if I ran too much, or whether it
is just a temporary setback.

### Strength session
+ *pullups* 5 - 3.75 - 3.25
+ *pushups* 10 - 10 - 9
+ *bearcrawls* 2 - 2 - 2

#### Comments
First time strength training in 2 months. I stopped because of shoulder
pain (right shoulder), but that did not go fully away yet. 
I don't think stopping strength training made it much better. 
Surprisingly, I have hardly dropped strength in two months.

## 2020-07-02

### Run
+ *Distance 5k*

#### Comments
The achilles tendons felt a bit sensitive, but in general it felt pretty
good. That led me to try doing two sprints, after which they felt
significantly more sensitive. Also a couple of days later, I feel them
more than usual. I think it is best to stop running for a while and
really faithfully do exercises every day and try running again in
August, to see whether that is a good strategy.

## 2020-07-06

### Strength session
+ *pullups* 5 - 4.5 - 3.75
+ *pushups* 12 - 10 - 10
+ *bearcrawls* 2 - 2 - 2
+ *rest* 5' - 5'

#### Comments
Today I felt tired, but nonetheless the pullups were easier than last
time. The first 5 could have been more, but I had to laugh too much.


## 2020-07-11

Got a tick bite, removed it the same day. On the left foot, near the
ankle. Should check in a few weeks, to see if it was correctly removed.


## 2020-07-19

### Boulder session
First boulder session in GRIP! Got a monthly subscription, so I will be
going a lot. I did grade 3 and 4 boulders. Lot of forearm muscle pain
the next day.

## 2020-07-22

### Boulder session
Bouldered with Riccardo, did quite some grade 5 boulders, already felt
a bit stronger than last time.

## 2020-07-27

### Boulder session
Again tried many 5 boulders, got two ones which I did not send before.
The day after I had a lot less soreness in the forearms already.

## 2020-07-29

### Strength session
+ *pullups* 5 - 4.75 - 4
+ *pushups* 13 - 11 - 11
+ *pistol squats* 1 - 2 - 3
+ *bearcrawls* 2 - 2 - 2
+ *rest* 5' - 5'

#### Comments
My endurance seems to have increased, but max strength not too much. In
the pullups I felt that the forearms were tired more quickly than the
upper arms. Probably from climbing on monday. I started with pistol
squats, using a book under the heel. I will gradually increase this
until I hit max and then work towards removing the book.

## 2020-07-30

### Boulder session
The two 5 boulders I did not send last time, I still did not, although
I tried many times. I did do a 6a dynamic one and felt in general
stronger in terms of grip.

## 2020-08-02

### Boulder session
Managed to send the two 5 boulders, today really quickly. One in one go
and the other after two or three tries. Also tried a couple of 6a 
boulders and that went generally quite well. I notice that recovery seems 
to be going quick.

## 2020-08-16

### Boulder session
Good session, although I felt a bit less strong than last session. The
overhanging 5 still took me 10+ tries, but I sent it again.

### Logging weight
I want to log my weight, such that I can do food experiments without
getting lighter. It is also nice to be able to see weight progress and
maybe correlate it with some things. Today I wanted to establish the
time of day where I am lightest and weighed myself six times.

+ After morning pee: 57.9
+ After breakfast: 58.7
+ Before lunch: 58.3
+ After lunch: 59.0
+ Before dinner: 58.3
+ After dinner: 59.4

From this it seems the morning is the lightest, so I will take that as
reference point. I forgot to weigh before sleep, so will do that 
tomorrow.

Great session, felt quite strong in the fingers, despite going

arena.

Even though this was the third session in 4 days, I felt strongest in
the fingers for all of them. I was struggling before on a 5 and a 6a
boulder and still did not get them, but got very close on both, so at 
least progress. Tweaked my neck a little on the 5 and started feeling
my right shoulder. I did send one new 6a.

Highest grade climbed: 6a

Start of soup experiment. For dinner only eat 2 bowls of soup, without
bread, maybe some fruit as desert. The intention is to eat less at night
for circadion rhythm. This is why I started logging weight, because I
don't want to lose any.

### Weight
57.9

## 2020-08-25

In general recovery of sunday is going well, but I have been too hard on
the fingers. I feel the tendons in a couple of fingers, so I think it is
better to reduce training intensity a bit and focus on technique on
easier boulders. Maybe only one session a week where I push with finger
strength.

### Boulder session
Today I purposely climbed mostly 3 and 4 boulders, because I still felt
some fingers after last time. I think I went way too heavy and 
uncontrolled on very fingery boulders and should first recover, before
trying those things again. I focussed on climbing with good body
position and footwork, was a really nice session.

Highest grade climbed: 5

Really low weight, I think because I hardly had lunch yesterday. Will
try to eat a lot this weekend and see if it will go up again.

### Weight

## 2020-08-31

### Boulder session
I did kind of the same format as last time, so mostly easier (for me)
boulders which were not too fingery. Overall felt really smooth, and
even flashed a 6a, which I had done a couple sessions back. So strength
is definitely improving.

Highest grade climbed: 6a

#### Comments
Wow, a lot stronger even though the last session was a month ago. 
Pullups have improved the most, that is to be expected from climbing.
The second set of pullups was interrupted, because I had to laugh.
Pushups have slightly increased, but the first ten felt like a breeze.
Really positive session, should do more often :).

## 2020-09-03

### Weight

### Boulder session
Again I did very slow warmup, starting with many 3 and 4 boulders, and
also climbing almost everything up and down. I find this is quite fun
and makes you go through very different motions. Even though I did a
strength workout yesterday, I felt quite strong. I did three new 6a
boulders and even flashed one of them. Time for some careful exploration
of some 6b. Still feel the middle fingers and a little bit the right
ring finger, though.

Fingers are still a bit sensitive, so that is two weeks now. I think
that they are improving. I should continue to watch out for crimping
too much and slipping feet. There were some new 5 and 6a boulders. Did
two new 6a boulders, so still feeling stronger.

Fingers start to feel better now during the session. I am also making
sure I move with control, especially the feet, on fingery boulders.
There were new 5 boulders today and I did all but one. I flashed quite
some and a couple were a bit harder. One I did a couple successive 
tries, but kind of messed up the end. I came back to it 15 minutes
later and did it at once. I should really start working some 6b as well.

I did a strength session by doing pullups on a small wooden shed, 
pushups on an incline and one leg squats. It was a nice session, I 
really tried going to fatigue with the squats and reached it. But it
took many squats, especially on the left leg.

Had one week of vacation last week, where I ate a lot and many times a
day. Seems I can put on weight after all.

## 2020-09-22

### Boulder session
Best news is that my fingers seem completely healed! So I will keep
watching myself, that I try not to get unprediced footslips. Got
some progress on some 6a and 6b. I think some 6b's should be doable.

Logging my food today to find out how many calories I eat approximately.

Lunch ingredients:
+ 1 onion
+ 600g potato
+ 500g sperziebonen
+ 800g red cabbage

According to cronometer I ate about 2700 kcal today. I want to try and
increase that with about 500 kcal. That should give me quite some extra
energy during the day and help me put on some weight.

Good session, felt certainly stronger than last time. I flashed a 6a,
that was really cool. I also did another 6a, that I had been trying for
quite some time. I made progress on two other 6a's, until the 
penultimate move, so I hope to send those next time. Also tried a couple
more 6b, but most are hard. I should work on slab, because still one
5 boulder not sent.

New 6a boulders, really nice challenge for the coming two months. The
difficulty is a wide range for me. I flashed one and another in two
tries. Others I tried many time, but only a little progress. I did do
a 6a slab as well with quite some work, but really happy I got it.

Sent two new 6a boulders I think (or three, I don't exactly remember).
I made it my goal to send all of them before they get changed. Some will
be tough, but it is my level. Also finally sent the 5 slab problem that
I failed over and over.

+ *rest* 5' - 5'

#### Comments
I did not feel very good during the session and afterwards I was very
tired and layed down for 15'. Causes may be tiredness from climbing
yesterday or eating too many chocoladepepernoten before the session.
Pullups have improved the most, but pushups also a little bit. The
scoring for pistol squats is L/R. I first do left until fatigue and then
right. Next time I will do pushups and squats first, suggestion of Cynt.

### Kracht Cynt

Om te beginnen 1 rondje, en niet te ver gaan. Eerst maar eens kijken
hoeveel spierpijn de volgende dag. Squats helemaal diep kraakte en was
een vervelend gevoel, daarom niet tot maximale diepte.

## 2020-10-06

Good session, but did not send any new 6a. There is one 6a slab that is
super hard for me. Hopefully will be able to get it soon. Good to work
on.

### Boulder session
A bit longer between boulder sessions than usual, because of waiting
for corona test results. I felt really good and strong this time and
sent two new 6a boulders and almost did another. That one had a really
small last hold that I had not anticipated. So I am getting well under
way with sending all 6a's in the gym.

Sent two new 6a. One slab and one which I almost got last time. Also
almost sent another, but I did not dare to climb it out (was a slab).
This week new 6b, I think a 6b should be possible before they get
changed up.

Sent two new 6a again, only four to go now. One was the really tough

I got it. Also got the one where I needed to sit and did not dare to go
on last time.

## 2020-10-27

### Boulder session
Warmed up really slow, because it was cold outside, but that worked
well. I sent two 6a (one in arena) and forgot about one, so still need
to do 4. Also tried a bunch of 6b quickly and think some are definitely
doable.

Bouldered together with Riccardo. There is one 6a in a ceiling, which
I did supermessy, feet cut loose about 4 or 5 times. Made it to the
penultimate hold, should get it easily next time.
