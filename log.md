I started doing strength training in the spirit of the 
'Primal Blueprint' by Mark Sisson. This means I do a short, but intense,
strength training session about every 10 days. According to PB this
should only be done when feeling good and energized. The 10 days then
leaves plenty of time for the muscles to restore and grow a little
stronger.

Doing pullups, pushups and bear walks.

Also did 'Sportklimmen A', first climbing course.

Starting regular strength workouts. The current program is:
1. Pull ups until failure, hold at last (partial) pull up.
2. Push ups on fists until close to failure.
3. One round of bear crawls through the room.

The above three points I do three times in a row. For the last time, I
push up until failure and do two rounds of bear crawls.
I do some shaking and stretching in between all exercises.

In January I progressed from 2 pull ups the first rep to 4 pull ups the
first rep.

Started to incorporate tabletop holds into the strength training routine
to prepare for handstand.

comments: had climbing yesterday, might be bit tired still. first effort
	felt good, feel like i am getting stronger. 
	tabletop hold for 60'' resulted in twitching in lower left arm.
	Had to go pretty deep for 60''.
