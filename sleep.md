# Sleep optimization

I want to optimize sleep as part of my journey towards the 2028 
olympics, but anyway as a key habit for life. Currently, these are my
plans, but I have to read up on the literature.

## Plan

- [x]: No screens after 22:00
- [ ]: Rhythm; always up at 07:30
- [ ]: No drinks after ??:??
- [ ]: Minimize blue light
- [ ]: Investigate how much darkness matters
